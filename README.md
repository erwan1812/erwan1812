### Hi there 👋

I'm Erwan, a French engineering student who loves to data and sports! 👩‍💻

The languages I m-love the most is Python with Jupyter Notebook 🐍. I always try to have a project in progress, whether personal or for school. I hope you will be as enthusiastic about my projects as I am about them! 🤩

## 📚 Current project

## 📌 School or former projects

I've made some other projects:
- 💥 [Forum management](https://github.com/erwan1812/ece-webapp-Bonnefond-Freisz): creation of a forum management website using a supabase database in the backend and next js and react in the frontend
- [Devops Project](https://github.com/erwan1812/ece-devops_project-Bonnefond-Freisz): This is a nodejs application that stores data on a Redis database. It's an application implementing an api with CRUD user functionality. And a database via Redis.
